{"name":"Eagles-wings","tagline":"A JNIBWAPI bot for playing StarCraft: Brood War","body":"Strategy game AI has been in development for a long time. Perhaps most famously, the AI Deep Blue was known for defeating chess champion Garry Kasparov in 1997. Deep Blue used opening and closing tables extensively, but achieved its strength mainly through brute force searching of the game space. However, modern video games - including the real-time strategy genre - involve continuous positions and simulatenous gameplay, making any sort of tree traversal search infeasible. This calls for a vastly different AI structure to play the modern strategy game.\r\n\r\n<Insert name> is a finite state automata designed to play Blizzard's iconic real-time strategy game StarCraft: Brood War. It makes use of the third-party libraries BWAPI and BWMirror to interface with the game as a player.\r\n\r\n# Design Principles\r\n## Non-Cheating\r\nBecause of the challenges involved in making a strong AI player, most developers tend to only ship a mediocre opponent and rely on giving the AI information and resources that are normally unavailable to a player in order to present a challenge. For example, the AI opponent may be able to see into the fog of war, or receive free resources and units.\r\nBWAPI restricts the information that the AI can obtain to the same information that would be available to a player in the game. The AI may not see units and buildings that have passed into the fog of war. BWAPI also restricts the commands that may be issued by the AI. The AI may only build units and otherwise issue commands that a player would be allowed to.\r\n## Competitive\r\nThe primary purpose of <Insert name> is to compete against other AIs of the same type. Tournaments hosted by various organizations such as <insert here> pit AI against AI. The goal of <Insert name> is to achieve a high ranking on the tournament ladder.\r\n## Adaptive\r\nAIs also tend to play against human opponents. Here, <Insert name> should be able to hold its own against poor to intermediate opponents. A large complication in playing against human opponents is their unpredictability. <Insert name> should be able to adapt to changing situations, including some anti-computer tactics employed by human opponents.\r\n## Modular\r\nThe source code of the AI should be built to accomodate a number of strategies. Adjustments to the core strategy and details alike should be easy to make.\r\n\r\n# Features\r\nDebug Manager","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
